# Summary

Here is an experimental, parametric 3D printable Eurorack rail designed to accommodate sliding nuts and potentially threaded strips (haven't tested that out yet). Adjust the parameters to suit your needs and accomodate nuts. Defaults take a standard M3 square nut for the sliding rails and an M6 nut to affix the rail to the bracket. If the nuts are a little tight, you can try "manually" sliding them around. This is designed to work well with my <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2502738"> Parametric Eurorack Bracket</a>, so check it out when you get the chace.

I recommend printing with a stiff filament such as a carbon-fiber PLA.

ATTENTION: This is an experimental design provided for fun, and I can make no claims about its safety to you or your expensive modular synthesizer. Some power modules rely on having a metal rail for heat dissipation, something for which a plastic rail is probably inadequate. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Mk2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .35
Infill: 15

Notes: 
A stiff material is preferred. A quality carbon fiber PLA works very well, but most PLA might work reasonably well, if printed dense enough,

Print either with the "front" of the rail against the bed or standing vertically on one of its ends.
